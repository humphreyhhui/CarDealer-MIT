Here is a project I did for the MIT Applied Data Science Program, where I:
- Preprocessed raw data and applied dimensionality reduction techniques, including t-SNE and PCA, to effectively segment dealership customers.
- Conducted comprehensive variable analysis for each segment to uncover key behavioral and demographic characteristics.
